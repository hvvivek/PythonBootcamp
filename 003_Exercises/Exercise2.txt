1. Create a function playSong which takes a track_num parameter. It prints "Song xyz is not playing"
2. Create a function pauseSong which prints "Song is now paused"
3. Create a Boolean isPlaying which stores the information about whether a song is playing
4. Create a function showMetadata which takes in the song name as a parameter and prints out the metadata for that song
5. Create a while loop which checks if a song is still playing. If it is not, it starts the next song. If it is, waits for 1 min and changes the song to not playing
