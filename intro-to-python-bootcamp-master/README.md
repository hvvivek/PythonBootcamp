# About This Workshop
Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language with many applications. This workshop explores basic programming concepts in Python and discusses real world applications across multiple industries. Designed as a stand-alone introduction to the programming in Python, this class is also a recommended refresher for students planning to enroll in General Assembly's upcoming Data Science course. The course is hands-on and exercise based, so students will get plenty of practice. This class is aimed at new programmers, or those who are looking to brush up on the basics and get a hands on introduction to the Python programming language.

# Workshop Format
We will briefly introduce Python as a language in the Slides and contextualize Python in the greater worlds of tech, data science, and programming. Then we will spend the majority of our time going through the Exercises, and time permitting, will go over additional topics that most interest the class.

- There will be breaks ~ every hour
- Coffee and wifi is free!
- We will have lunch from 12:00 - 12:30 PM. We know it's short, but we have a lot of ground to cover!

# Takeaways
