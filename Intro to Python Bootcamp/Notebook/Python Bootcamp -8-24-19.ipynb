    "The most important thing to realize here is that only one conditional block will run in an `if`, `elif`, `else` chain, so the order you put the conditions in can be important. In this case, if you were to check `i % 3 == 0` or `i % 5 == 0` before `i % 15 == 0`, you would never see `\"Fizzbuzz\"` for numbers divisible by `15` since one of the other two conditions would have been true before it every reached the `i % 15 == 0` condition. Therefore, the `i % 15 == 0` condition has to be checked first in each iteration. It's also important to note that `i % 15 == 0` is a stand in for `i % 5 == 0 and i % 3 == 0` since any number divisible by `5` and `3` must be divisible by `15`:\n",
